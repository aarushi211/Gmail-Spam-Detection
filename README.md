This project consists of simple pre-processing steps using nltk library and machine learning models for training.

The pre-processing steps include -
  1. Tokenization: This is used to break huge chunks of data into smaller parts called tokens.
  2. Stemming: It is used to remove the suffix of the word and convert the word into core words. This helps in reducing the dimensionality of the data.
  3. Lemmitization: It is similar to stemming with the differece that it creates more realistic words unlike in stemming.
  4. Stop Words: This is used to help remove overly common words that do npt pose any such important meaning to the text.
  5. Vectorization: Since, machines are unable to understand textual data, words are converted into vectors so that machines are able to understand them.

The various machine learning models I used are -
  1. Logistic Regression: It is a supervised machine learning model commonly used in case of binary outcomes.
  3. Linear Support Vector Classifier: In this a linear kernel function is applied to perform classification.
